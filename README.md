# React Bricks starter with Next.js with Tailwind CSS and React Bricks UI

Kick-start your project with this boilerplate for a complete Next.js website based on [React Bricks](https://reactbricks.com), with both the front-end and admin dashboard.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

We suggest that you use the CLI and choose this starter.  
In this way you will have the credentials already set up in a `.env.local` file:

```bash
npx create-reactbricks-app
# or
yarn create reactbricks-app
```

Otherwise you can directly clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reactbricks/nextjs-starter-reactbricks-tailwind your-project
```

## ðŸ“– Documentation

Please, read our documentation at [Reactbricks.com](https://reactbricks.com).

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
